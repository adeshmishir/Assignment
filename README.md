Actor Used for Testing:
I used the apify/website-content-crawler actor for testing. It accepts a URL and extracts content from the website.


Assumptions & Design Choices:
Built using React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Node.js, and Express.js.
Frontend allows login, actor listing, schema-based input form, and output display.
Used localStorage to store the API key.
Single-page app with responsive UI and smooth user experience.
Implemented pagination, toaster notifications, and form validation.


Working Flow:
Login using your Apify API Key.
Browse and select an actor.
Dynamic form loads based on the actor's input schema.
Fill in details and run the actor.
View the result/output.
